                <h2>What can I expect out of a Megagame?</h2>
                <p>Players are usually split up into teams that might need to compete or cooperate with each other. We will send you an information package about 2 weeks before the event date for you to review game mechanics, your role, and any background material (we try to keep it brief).</p>
                <p>Megagames are designed to be learned on the fly, just like real life. They are about experiencing the journey, rather than mapping out a path to victory. Above all, experienced players and the control team (aka, the game facilitators) are very nice. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed at first, please reach out if you feel lost!</p>
                <p>Many players like to dress up as a team, but this isn’t required. </p>
                <p>Games usually last 6-8 hours on a strict timeline, including a brief and debrief. Afterwards, the moderating team and most players usually meet at a local pub to unwind and talk about the game. That’s when most people can find out what was happening on the other side of the room.</p>

                <h2>How can I sign up?</h2>
                <p>You can buy tickets on each individual event’s <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/ottawa-megagames-20234788910" target="blank">Eventbrite page</a>. They will have information on how teams are split up, so you can buy tickets in groups if you want to play with friends. There will also be information on food for that event (we sometimes work with caterers to offer lunch packages with tickets).</p>

                <h2>What is your safety policy?</h2>
                <p>These games, and this group, are about the spirit of collaborative gameplay. This group and the events hosted within it do not stand for any racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted behaviour. We care about providing a healthy and cooperative gaming scene for everyone. If we see or hear any abuse, the offending player will be reprimanded, and, if necessary, expelled for an indefinite duration. Please feel free to reach out to any of the moderators if you know of this behaviour happening in this community. We're here to support you.</p>

                <h2>Where are your events held?</h2>
                <p>We run events in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, but we have worked with groups from Toronto to Montreal, as well as international groups (see our <a href="/partners.html">Partners page</a>). We have worked with venues such as the Diefenbunker Museum, Laurier House and the Ecclesiax Church, and are exploring other venues in town.</p>

                <h2>Can I volunteer with you?</h2>
                <p>We’re always looking to add to our moderator team. We have moderators from RPG, LARP, board game, war game, and improv backgrounds. We’re looking for empathetic, quick-thinking mods who are good at communicating. If you <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> we can play some games with you, figure out what role fits you best and pair you up with one of our more experienced mods.</p>

                <h2>Where does the ticket cost go?</h2>
                <p>Usually our biggest expense is the venue. The rest of the money goes towards printing, components, insurance, and licensing fees for the systems we use. Generally we keep our ticket prices as low as possible to let as many people play as we can, and any leftover profit goes towards appetizers at the pub afterwards. Moving forward, we will be implementing a discounted price ticket available for anyone for whom cost is a barrier of entry.</p>

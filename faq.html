        <h2>What can I expect out of a Megagame?</h2>
        <p>Players are usually split up into teams that might need to compete or cooperate with each other. We will send you an information package about 2 weeks before the event date for you to review game mechanics, your role, and any background material (we try to keep it brief).</p>
        <p>Megagames are designed to be learned on the fly, just like real life. They are about experiencing the journey, rather than mapping out a path to victory. Above all, experienced players and the control team (aka, the game facilitators) are very nice. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed at first, please reach out if you feel lost!</p>
        <p>Many players like to dress up as a team, but this isn’t required. </p>
        <p>Games usually last 6-8 hours on a strict timeline, including a brief and debrief. Afterwards, the moderating team and most players usually meet at a local pub to unwind and talk about the game. That’s when most people can find out what was happening on the other side of the room.</p>

        <h2>How can I sign up?</h2>
        <p>You can buy tickets on each individual event’s <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/ottawa-megagames-20234788910" target="blank">Eventbrite page</a>. They will have information on how teams are split up, so you can buy tickets in groups if you want to play with friends. There will also be information on food for that event (we sometimes work with caterers to offer lunch packages with tickets).</p>

        <h2>Can I volunteer with you?</h2>
        <p>We’re always looking to add to our moderator team. We have moderators from RPG, LARP, board game, war game, and improv backgrounds. We’re looking for empathetic, quick-thinking mods who are good at communicating. If you <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> we can play some games with you, figure out what role fits you best and pair you up with one of our more experienced mods.</p>

        <h2>Can I hire you to run a private event?</h2>
        <p>We are always open to hosting private events, including bachelor parties, birthdays and corporate team building exercises. If you <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> we can discuss your scope, audience and budget and come up with a custom experience for you.</p>

        <h2>What is your safety policy?</h2>
        <p>These games, and this group, are about the spirit of collaborative gameplay. This group and the events hosted within it do not stand for any racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted behaviour. We care about providing a healthy and cooperative gaming scene for everyone. If we see or hear any abuse, the offending player will be reprimanded, and, if necessary, expelled for an indefinite duration. Please feel free to reach out to any of the moderators if you know of this behaviour happening in this community. We're here to support you.</p>
